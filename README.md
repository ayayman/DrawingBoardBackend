Description of that repo goes here. And here's another sentence that describes this pile of unimaginable shit

The application is a document indexer written in Spring Boot.  
It allows storing arbitrary files and, if possible, extracting and indexing their content. Upon building an inverted index, it provides means for querying it.

The project is divided into 2 modules:  
 - backend: responsible for storing/processing documents and exposing a REST API  
 - client: a simple console application for interacting with the API

This is a standard maven project and as such is fairly easy to build.
